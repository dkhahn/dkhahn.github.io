    As an American, Europe is so closely linked to us that it feels comfortable enough to visit 
    as often as possible, while still being enamored with the history, better food, and fabulous arcitecture.

        <h3> London</h3>
        <body> My first trip without my parents was to London and the surrounding area. I have since been back as an adult, but that first trip was so special. 
            I went as a student ambassador and therefore the trip was a lot of learning. I think I've been to every castle within 3 hours of London. Luckily, history is my favorite so I didn't mind. 
            Learning about Henry VIII and his many wives left quite the impression on me as a child, especially after seeing the Tower of London. 
            As an adult, I got to enjoy more of the modern London. Getting to watch Wimbledon, see the James Bond museum, the musical Mamma Mia!, and walk through Notting Hill were all highlights. 
            Overall I've always liked London but I would say never planned my own trips there.

        <h3> Brighton </h3>
        <body> I did a homestay with a family in Brighton the summer I was 13, which was perfect for a 13 year old. Brighton is a popular summer destination, and since I was there in the summer
            there were plenty of activities to do. We went to the pier and played carnival games, swam, and learned some water sports while I was there. I learned to wind-surf and attempted to learn how to sail. 
            We also canoed. It was the perfect summer retreat and the family I stayed with was so gracious to show me a good time.

        <h3> Dublin</h3>
        <body> Dublin was a lot smaller than I imagined it would be. I spent 3 days here, and thought that was a perfect amount of time if you're just trying to see the city. 
            I was traveling alone, so I pretty much went and saw every sight you could. I enjoyed checking out Temple Bar- I was there during the Euro Cup and got to watch a soccer game
            with some very exicted Irishmen. Leaving the city, I really enjoyed the Cliffs of Moher. They were beautiful, and so nice to walk around.

        <h3> Barcelona </h3>
        <body> Barcelona is such a beautiful city with so much to offer. I love wandering around the city. The architecture is beautiful, epscially Gaudi's Parc Guell. 
            Spain is so lovely in that they make up their own rules; they do siesta, sometimes things are closed for random holidays you would never know, and dinner is at 8 PM or later. 
            It's so different but in a wonderful way. Some highlights from my trips there are La Segrada Familia, Montserrat, eating at Da Greco, and walking along the beach. I recently had friends
            move to the neighborhood Gracia, which I would also reccomend. 
        </body>

        <h3> Cadiz </h3>
        <body> This is definitely not the normal time to visit Cadiz, but I was there during the end November. Cadiz is a beach town, but I thought it was lovely to be there when there were no tourists. 
            Cadiz is beautiful and a little sleepy in the winter. The Catedral de Cadiz and visiting the monkeys at Gibraltar were the highlights, along with amazing food and great walking around. 
            I would love to go back in the summer. 
        </body>
        <p> <strong> Must do:</strong> Gibraltar and go to the top of Catedral de Cadiz </p>

        <h3> Paris </h3>
        <body> Paris! What is not to love about Paris. Each time I go, I love it more. There seems to be an endless amount of things to do. But the best thing is walking around and doing whatever strikes your fancy. 
            Popping into a boulangerie for a croissant or tarte citron. Walking through the Tulleries. Or Marais. Or whatever museum strikes your fancy. 
            I've been to Versialles which was amazing, up the Eiffel Tower which was okay, and on top of the Arc de Triomph which was more fun than I was expecting. 
            As I said there are a million things to do, but I love walking around St. Germain or Le Marais neighborhoods the most. Montmarte is also great (just more crowded). I think that the Lourve should be done by everyone once,
            but not necessarily for more than a day. My favorite musuem that I've been to (there's still so many more to visit!) is Musee Le Orangerie. It holds Monet's water lillies, and they are spectacular. 
            For food, I would reccomend eating as much bread and cheese as you'd like. And getting tarte citron's everywhere. The crepes I think can be missed, but not a croque madame. 
        </body>
        <p> <strong> Must do: </strong> Watch the Eiffel Tower sparkle at night, visit Musee Le Orangerie, have a tarte citron. </p>

        <h3> Nice </h3>
        <body> Nice is a beautiful little city. I haven't been anywhere else on the French Riviera, but I thought Nice was pretty calm and great to walk around. It's not too big, but there are still plenty to see and do. 
            I loved admiring the colorful buildings as we walked around. But one of my favorite things we did was check out Castle Hill. You can see all of Nice from the view, and it's stunning. Also grabbing a bottle of champagne
            and a baguette and sitting along the lovely (albeit rocky) beach is a must. I ate such great food in Nice but am always terrible about writing restaurants down. 
            I did have a truffle pasts that was amazing. 
        </body>
        <p> <strong> Must do: </strong> Castle Hill, picnic on the beach.</p>

        <h3> Munich </h3>
        <body> I did not get to explore as much of Munich as I would have liked. What I did get to see was beautiful yellow mustard flower feilds, the amazing English Gardenn, and enjoy 
            delicious sausage and sauerkraut. The English Gardens was the highlight; it's huge and beautiful. There is a river that runs through where people surf, no matter the weater!

        <h3> Berlin </h3>
        <body> Berlin is another city I was sadly only in for 2 days, so I tried to make the most of it. Berlin has such an interesting history that I tried to capture as much of as possible in my short
            time there. The Memorial for the Murdered Jews of Europe and Berlin wall were striking, powerful, and very moving. I'm glad I got to see both. I also saw the Berlin Cathedral which was beautiful.
            The highlight for me was getting to watch a Euro Cup match on the Bradenburg gate; there were so many people out to celebrate and watch their team, that I sort of stumbled into it and couldn't leave. 
            Overall, I left Berlin feeling like I had so many more things to do and see there that I'll have to go back. 
        </body>
        <p> <strong> Must do:</strong> Berlin Cathedral </p>

        <h3> Niedernhausen</h3>
        <body> I had family that was living in Niedernhausen area, so on one of my trips I made a detour to see them. I'm so glad I did. I got to expereince smaller
            German cities which I'm not sure I would have otherwise. They lived the most picturesque town, where my cousins informed me it was laid out like any smaller German town;
        a train stop, a post office, a bakery, and a church from the 13th centruy....all about the same. While I was staying with them I got to explore
        Mainz, Idstien, and Wiesbaden. Mainz was having a Frulingsfest, which meant rides, carnival games, candy, and dirnks. Idstein was so beautiful it looked out of a classic 
        storytale. The buildings were magnificent. And then Weisbaden, the largest city in the area, had great bustling markets and restaurants. 
        I was struck by how much history there was in each of these places and how old and beautiful they were. I'm so glad I got to experience the smaller parts of Germany.  </body>
        <p> <strong> Must do: </strong> Visit Idstien and walk through town</p>

<div class="italy">
    <h1> Italy </h1>
        <h3> Rome </h3>
        <body> I stayed in Rome for 3 months in college. I love Rome... I think it is one of the most beautiful cities. The Italians are wonderful people 
            and the food and history is amazing. What's not to like. I'm so thankful I got to be in Italy for 3 months. It allowed me to explore and take my time with the city, which was invaluable. 
            I stayed in the Campo di Fiore, so one of my favorite things was to wake up to the open air market outside. They sold the best fruits, vegetables, and treats. I'd get my cheap, delicious 
            cappaccino and a cup of fruit and be on my way. From the Campo, there is a meandering walk that takes you to everything (I think) you'd want to see: the Piazza Navona, Pantheon, Trevi Fountain, 
            and spits you out at the Spanish Steps. I did this walk many times and never got tired of it. 
            Beyond the Spanish Steps is the Villa Borghese and it's gardens. I would reccomend Villa Borghese to see all the beautiful Bernini statues. But, the gardens are also great. You can rent bikes
            and speed through the gardens, or walk and enjoy them. Then of course there is the Colessium and Palatine Hill. These are definitley worth seeing, but I wouldn't stay out near them. It's a little off 
            the beaten track. Another great area is Trasteverre. <br>
            Good food is not something you'll be lacking in room-- pretty much any Osteria is going to be amazing. 
            <p> <strong> Must do:</strong> Visit the Trevi Fountain, have pasta carbonara, walk around with gelato</p>

        <h3> Verona </h3>
        <body> Verona surprised me. I really enjoyed the week that I spent here. Learned the lovely Italian custom of apertivo, or happy hour. But with more food. 
            And enjoyed the beautiful surroundings! Of course saw Juliet's house of Romeo and Juliet. Saw the Piazza de Erbe and Castleveccio as well as the famous Ponte Pietra. From Verona I was also able to do 
            a few day trips as well-- Bologna, Lake Garda, and Vallpollicella. Vallpollicella was amazing, beacause it's one of the best wine regions in the world. 
            To be able to do wine tastings as these beautiful estates was a dream. Lake Garda was so much fun, beacuse my friends and I rented boats to cruise around the lake on. And Bologna was 
            a great day trip. 
            <p> <strong> Must do: </strong> Castleveccio and Lake Garda</p>

        <h3> Venice </h3>
        <body> I loved visiting Venice. It's a city that easy to get lost in, with it's tight canals and bridges everywhere. But then you come out from the canals onto Piazza San Marco and the sea, and you can see everything. I think 
            Venice is magical in that way. One of the best experiences I had there was that our group got to be inside Basilica di San Marco, alone, as the sun set and the ceiling turns to gold. All of a sudden the entire domes turn a bright and beautiful
            gold. We laid on the floor to get the full experience, and it was unforgettable. That plus a gondola ride made Venice an experience I will never forget. 
            <p> <strong> Must do: </strong> Lunch along the Grand Canal</p>

        <h3> Padua </h3>
        <body> Padua has a lot of history, which is why we made a stop there. It has one of the oldest universities.
            The main attraction, the Basilica di San Antonio, was built in the 13th century and still stands just as grand. 
            With so many amazing things to see in Italy I don't think I would have planned to visit Padua on my own, but enjoyed
            my time there all the same. 
            <br>

        <h3> Florence </h3>
        <body> As we made our way from the North to the South, we had to make a stop in Florence. I could have spent so much time here. 
            I love the Tuscany region, and Florence feels like the crown jewel. Climbing up the Duomo, visiting Michelangelo's "David", 
            going through the Uffizi Gallary, and walking along Ponte Vecchio were all highlights. But so were the unexpcted things, like enjoying 
            amazing gelato and finding a true Italian leather jacket. The culture in Florence was amazing to partake in and the buidlings were 
            so beautiful to walk amoungst. I would definitely reccomend. 
            <p> <strong> Must do: </strong> Climb to the top of the Duomo </p>

        <h3> Cinque Terre </h3>
        <body> Cinque Terre was a perfect combination of magnificent scenery, hiking, beaching, and eating. Cinque Terre is made up of five towns that you 
            can get to via train or through hiking. We opted to do the hike, which I would reccomend to anyone who is able to. It makes the views you see that much mode
            worthwhile. My friends and I stayed in Monterroso al Mare, the furthest town away. It is the flatest and has the largest beach, which we liked. 
            I think my favorite to hike into was Vernazza, beause it was so picturesque. But they are all amazing. Riomaggiore is the largest (which isn't saying a ton), then there 
            is also Manarola and Corneglia. We spent the least amount of time in Corneglia. All of the towns offer great 
            seafood, beautiful and colorful buildings, and the chance to walk around looking into shops. The buildings themselves, built into the cliffs, are the real atrraction. 
            <p> <strong> Must do: </strong> Visit this area! </p>

        <h3> Amalfi Coast </h3>
        <body> The finale on my Italian tour is the lovely Amalfi Coast. Amalfi is just as beautiful as everyone says it is. I stayed in Sorrento but did not spend much time there.
            Most of my time was spent in Positano and Capri. Positano was great, and exactly what you would expect. The cute umbrellas on the beach, walking up the stairs in the town to shop
            and eat. But Capri was my favorite place. The water was perfectly blue and you can climb and take the gondola up to Anacapri to really get a view of the island. But the best part is taking small boats 
            to see the Blue Grotto. And in general, boating around the island. It was paradise and I hated to leave. 
            <p> <strong> Must do:</strong> The Blue Grotto </p>

    <h1> Denmark </h1>
        <h2> Copenhagen </h2>
        <body> My first foray into the Scandinavian countries was great. Copenhagen was a very walkable city and I enjoyed getting to explore a different culture. 
            Things are more expensive, but everything is nicer. We could get a great meal on the go at 7-11! Walking along Nyhavn Canal, taking a tour of Queen Margrethe's Palace, and the Tivoli Gardnes were all great. 
            A highlight was exploring the illegal, but sort-of excepted, Christiania community. If I remember correctly, it's a kind of hippy community that the government doesn't love. You aren't allowed to take pictures 
            and it may have been shut down, but we have a local friend with us who showed us the ropes. Another favorite thing was they have trampolines along one of the main 
            canals, which is so much fun to test out. 
        </body>

    <h1> Hungary </h1>
        <h2> Budapest</h2>
        <body> In the short weekend I was there I had a great time exploring Budapest. The politics can be a little bit rocky, 
            but the city is beautiful and full of things to do. Some of my favorites were the Szechenyi Thermal Baths, taking a boat tour 
            along the river Danube that splits Buda and Pest, and enjoying wonderful food. One of my favorite restaurants was Mazel Tov- the interior 
            is beautiful and it was just the fuel I needed after froliking in the thermal baths. I would definitely reccomend the boat tour, because 
            some of the main buildings along the Danube (like the parliment building) light up at night.

        <h2> Athens </h2>
        <body>  I spent 2 days in Athens and I thought that was the perfect amount. The best thing to do there is see the famous ruins. 
            Walking around Acropolis was exactly like being in the middle of a history lesson, and it was amazing. But you only need one day to 
            see Acropolis, and other than that I didn't think there was much else to do in Athens. There's plenty of day trips you can take out of the city. 
            But I spent my second day in Athens eating loukoumades and walking through the street markets.

        <h2> Santorini </h2>
        <body> I loved Santorini so much. I know I've said this about a few places, but Santorini was beautiful and magical. I stayed in Thira, which I would reccomend. 
            Oia is what you picture when you think of Santorini, but it can get crowded so I enjoyed just biking or driving over to spend time there. Either way, you can't go wrong. 
        The sunsets over the white hillside buildings, over the sea, are unbeatable. Not to mention there are so many things to do on Santorini! 
        One of my favorite memories is taking a catamaran out for a day on the water-- the water is so clear, cold, and refreshing it's amazing to be out on it. Plus, there are hot springs 
        you can go to from there. Another great thing is to rent ATV's and explore the island. You can go to Kamari, where more of the locals go and where I had the best lamb. You can 
        visit the Black Sand Beach, or just go back and forth between Oia and Thira! I thought ATVing was very safe. Oia also has great shopping-- there is a famous bookstore there that
        was amazing, and so many places to get Grecian sandals. The food is so good, you'll never want to leave! 
        <p> <strong> Must do: </strong> Some boating excursion, walk around Oia, eat all the Greek food </p>

            <h2> Vienna </h2>
            <body> On my European tour Vienna was not my favorite. But I still made the most of it, and like many places in Europe it has great sites to see and experiences to be had. 
                I took a tour of the Schonbrunn Palace, whcih was quite grand. The highlight was the famous ceiling in the great room. Vienna has plenty of museums to check out as well. 
                But my favorite thing I did was get cheap, standing room only, tickets to see an opera at the world famous Vienna Opera House. 
                I did not have any clothes appropriate for the opera, but because I was in the cheap seats I think it was okay. The opera house was stunning, 
                and it was my first opera. They were performing Macbeth (in German), which was beautiful. I'm really glad I made the impulse decision to go 
                because it was my favorite thing I did! I will say, Vienna felt a lot like being transported to the 19th century (there were plenty of horse-drawn carriages).

            <h2> Prague </h2>
            <body> Prague was my next stop after Vienna, and they felt like night and day. Prague felt colorful, yet Gothic,  
                and fun and exciting to walk around. I didn't mind being alone, and I loved the picturesque buildings. 
                Prague has an Old Town that was my favorite to spend time in. The view from the clock tower is beautiful- you can perfectly 
                see Prague Castle. Prague Castle is definitely worth at least walking around (it would take awhile to tour it!). Plus, on the grounds you can 
                see St. Vitus Cathedral which is a perfefct display of Gothic architecture. A walk along Charles Bridge is a must, along with trying 
                a super sugar-y Trdelnik cone. I also saw the John Lennon peace wall, which was eclectic. 
                Overall, walking around Prague felt like marveling at the best of Europe's ancient architecture and being amazed that it exists. I actually learned 
                while there that some buildings had to be rebuilt after World War II, and the city intentionally wanted it to feel like a movie set. And it does.

            <h2> Amsterdam</h2>
            <body> Amsterdam is a perfect city to walk around and wander in. The canals make the city feel confusing but calming, and I could get lost in them for hours. 
                Taking a boat tour along the canals is so much fun and you get to see the city in such a unique way. I also explored the Rijiksmuseum and Van Gogh museum, Anne 
                Frank's house, the Heineken experience, and flower market. The best thing about Amsterdam is the treats 
                you can grab to eat as you cross bridge after bridge. Their waffles with countless toppings are amazing, 
                and you have to try many combinations.
