<div class="intro">
    North America is my home continent, so sometimes I get caught up in not wanting to explore it as much. 
    But it has so much to offer and I love where I'm from.

<div class="unitedstates">
    <h1> United States</h1>

<div class="seattle"> 
    <h3> Seattle, Washington</h3>
    <body> Seattle is where I was born and raised. This city will always be special to me; there is the perfect combination of city and nature for everyone to find something to do. 
        Seattle is home to Pike Place Market (near where I lived!) which is a must see. The lakes are great to go boating on, and the mountains for skiing and hiking are just a short drive away! 
        Plus there is so much amazing seafood.

<div class="new york">
    <h3> New York City, New York</h3>
    <body> The city that never sleeps. What more can I say about New York that hasn't already been said. New York is where I am moving, and the reason it drew me in was the 
        undeniable energy the city has. It's the heart of the United States. The culture, food, city, and sites are something everyone has to see for themselves at least once. Some favorites
        include walking around Greenwich Village, eating at The Gnocceria in the East Village, attending as many comedy shows as possible, walking along the Highline, and seeing a show on Broadway.
    <br>
    <p> <strong> Must do: </strong> Visit the Empire State Building/a comedy show </p>

<div class="los angeles">
    <h3> Los Angeles, California</h3>
    <body> The U.S.'s other major city, L.A., is somewhere I've been lucky to visit at varying points in my life. The sunshine of Los Angeles is hard to beat; sprawling beaches, healthy food,
        and beauty are all things that draw people in. What draws my family in is Disneyland and Sunset Boulevard.
    </body>
    <p> <strong> Must do: </strong> Walk through Venice Beach/Santa Monica Pier </p>

<div class="san fran">
    <h3> San Francisco, California</h3>
    <body> I love San Francisco. To me, it's always felt like a combination of Seattle (where I grew up) and L.A. It's sunny
        but not too warm, and still has the same feeling as Seattle. But it's much bigger. And more hills to tackle. And fog that will randomly appear (aka- you always need a jacket).
        San Fran is a city I can get lost walking around in, feel perfectly comforable stopping at any of the many parks to rest when I need it,
        and then enjoying some amazing food at a quaint restaurant to round out the night. 
    </body>
    <p> <strong> Must do: </strong> Walk up Lombard Street </p>

    <h3> Denver, Colorado</h3>
    <body> Unlike the other cities on this list, I have only been to Denver once. I had a great time -- it did freak me out to feel more land locked than I'm used to
        but there is plenty to do to remedy that. We went to a concert at Red Rocks which I would definitely reccomend. The neighborhood I loved the most was RiNo, where there 
    are a ton of murals painted everywhere and casual, outdoor dining that was really fun to walk around and spend time in. </body>
</div>
<p> <strong> Must do: </strong> Check out Red Rocks </p>

    <h3> Austin, Texas</h3>
    <body> Austin has the feeling of an up and coming city and there's a youthful energy that reflects that. For someone from the Pacific Northwest, Texas is a far cry from home.
        The BBQ, heat, and cowboy hats can be a bit of a culture shock at first, but you do get used to it. Austin is very walkable, espcially along the river that almost cuts it in half. Zilker park
        is great to check out, along with South Congress. 
        The people are friendly which I really liked.
    </body>
    <p> <strong> Must do: </strong> Try the BBQ </p>

    <h3> Atlanta, Georgia</h3>
    <body> Atlanta is a bustling city that I wish I'd had more time in. I was only there for weekend over New Years Eve. It was sunny, albeit cold, but that did not stop me from exploring as much of 
        the city as I could. This included the Cenntennial Olympic park, there world famous aquarium, and Buckhead. I need to go back!
    </body>
    <p> <strong> Must do: </strong> Visit the aquarium </p>

    <h3> Boston, Massachusettes</h3>
    <body> I spent a summer interning in Boston and loved spending time in a city so full of history. I was interning for the Boston Red Sox, so I was quickly immersed in the East Coast traditions. 
        Living in Back Bay and spending plenty of time at Fenway, I feel like I got the quintessential Boston experience. It was great to make new friends, explore a city that I'd read so much about, and work for an organization
        that were very passionate about what they do. Some of my favorite memories include walking around Newbury Street, trying restaurants in Little Italy, and meeting new friends after Red Sox games. For this reason, Boston will always have a special
        place in my memories. 
    </body>
    <p> <strong> Must do:</strong> Visit the Boston Commons </p>

    <h3> Maui, Hawaii</h3>
    <body> Hawaii is one of the most beautiful places, I feel lucky to have visited a few times. It's so tropical that it always surprises me I am technically still in the U.S. Some of my favorite things I've done include 
        whale watching, ziplining, hiking, walking around Lahaina, visiting Mama's Fish House restaurant, and most importantly- enjoying the sun and sea.  
    </body>
    <p> <strong> Must do: </strong> Swim in the ocean </p>

    <h3> Vancouver, British Columbia</h3>
    <body> Growing up so close to Vancouver, I've been here multiple times. The city alwasy strikes me as so clean, so much more international than Seattle, and very peacful. 
        My favorite memories are coming up here with my family to visit cousins, walk along the beautiful waterfront, and come through on our way to Whistler. We visited Vancouver right before the city held the 
    2010 winter olympics, which made it buzzing and busy with anitipation.  </body>

    <h3> Toronto, Ontario</h3>
    <body> I did a trip to Toronto to see the city and Niagara Falls on a road trip back to the states. Toronto was great, and struck me as so different from the Vancouver I knew much better. I of course visited the 
        iconic CN Tower, which did not disapoint. St. Lawrence Market was also a highlight. However, the best way to see Toronto is walking around and exploring. On the way back from Toronto I stopped at Niagara Falls, which was
    amazing. The Canadian side is much better than the U.S. side, and waterfall is spectacular. I was very glad to have made a stop.  </body>

    <h3> Cabo San Lucas, Baja California</h3>
    <body> Cabo San Lucas is exactly what you would picture if you were imagining a perfect sunny desination. The water is blue, the beaches are white, and the weather is alwasy warm. 
        When I've gone to Cabo I've stayed at a resort. This seems like the best option price and safety wise (though I've never had any safety issues). My favorite thing to do is to just 
        enjoy the beach and the ocean. If I am going on an excursion, the boat trips are beautiful.
