<div class="intro"> 
<p> I have visited Australia a few times. In fact, it is the reason I got a passport! Having family live in Melbourne means that we visited for famiy vacations. </p>

    <h1> Melbourne </h1>
    <body> A huge part of what my family and I do in Melbourne is visit with our family. It was always confusing as a kid why we would be there 
        for Christmas, and Santa was wearing flip flops. The flipped seasons worked in our favor! Most of my memories include going to the beach, walking around 
        downtown (ACDC lane has some fun grafetti! ) and visiting the Melbourne zoo to get a good look at the animals that inhabit only Australia. But, the kangaroos were 
        never as exciting in the zoo because they frequented the backyard of my Aunt and Uncle.

    <h1> Sydney </h1> 
    <body> 
        Sydney is one of my favorite cities I've been to. I love all the harbors and how close to the water you are. It helps that 
        when I visited, my parents had a friend who took us boating around the city which was incredible. I loved seeing the Opera House, 
        walking around Darling Harbor and grabbing lunch there, going to Bondi Beach, and boating under the Harbor Bridge. 
        The Australians are such a fun-loving group of people, we had an amazing time. 
    <p> <strong> Must do: </strong> Spend as much time on the water as possible!</p>
