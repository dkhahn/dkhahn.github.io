    South America is somewhere I want to explore so much of; in the short amount of time 
    I've spent there I fell in love with the friendly people and colorful cities.

        <h3> Buenos Aires </h3>
        <body> Buenos Aires is a beautiful city. I arrived here alone, to meet up with a travel company where I wouldn't know anyone I was traveling with. I was nervous, intimidated, and a little overwhelmed. 
            And jet lagged. However, I navigated my way to the hotel and was struck by how lovely the streets of Buenos Aires were. And as I started walking around, I was less intimidated. Everyone speaks Spanish, which I knew a little of, but more
        importantly was very accodating to my half Spanish, half English plus hand gestrues approach to communication. 
    I loved wandering around Buenos Aires. The top two things I would reccomend are visiting the Recoleta Cemetary. It might sound creepy, but the headstones are no ordinary cemetary markers. The second thing is to check out La Boca. It is a neighborhood that is 
so colorful and fun-- it's very touristy but I thought it was worth it.   </body>
            <p> <strong> Must do: </strong> La Boca. And drinks at Salon 1923</p>

        <h3> Iguazu Falls </h3>
        <body> I visited both sides of Iguazu Falls- the Argentinian side and the Brazilian side. Both sides were amazing, and if you can do it this way I would reccomend it. 
            In general, Iguazu Falls was beautiful. It wasn't like other waterfalls I've seen. Iguazu's allure is in the sheer quantity of waterfalls (as opposed to height, width, etc.). There is still a look out point
            where the water narrows and you get that roaring, spraying waterfall power. I would say you need at least 2 days to explore the park. The whole thing is beautiful. You can take helicopter rides to get the magnitude of what you're seeing
            (which I did, and loved. Pictures someimes can't do it justice.

        <p> <strong> Must do: </strong> Take a boat down to the base of the falls </p>

    <h3> Rio de Janiero </h3>
    <body> Ah Rio. I loved Rio! Talk about a city that's alive. Rio was nothing like what I expected. People warned me of the dangers (especially going during Carnival). Maybe it's because I had these warnings and was careful, or maybe 
        because it just was all fine, but I had an amazing time. Rio de Janiero is HUGE and there are too many great things to do. Like I said, I was there during Carnival which meant more people, more craziness, and more fun. 
        I still did the sightseeing I was determined to do; Sugarloaf Mountain, Christ the Redeemer, Santa Teresa neighborhood, Museau do Amanha, and Ipanema Beach were all highlights and I would definetley reccomend. I met some lovely Brazilians who took me out to Lapa, which was fun and a famous 
        landmark. We also went dancing and enjoyed street food which was great. Our group also went to a futbol game, which was quite the experience. I am not a soccer/futbol fan. At all. But the atmosphere and dedication everyone watching that game brings...it was so much fun. They are on their feet the whole time.
        And singing, cheering. No one leaves for any reason. It was great. 
        I would go back to Rio in a heartbeat and have such wonderful memories there.

        <h3> St. Kitts and Nevis </h3>
        <body> St. Kitts and Nevis is to date the only country I've been to in the Caribbean, so it is getting lumped in with South America. 
            St. Kitts was the island my family and I stayed on, and it was paradise. I've never been somewhere with that kind of beauty. I loved watching how the Atlanti Ocean side was completely different than the Caribbean side. 
        The locals were very friendly explaining to me there hodge-podge language (brought on by complicated years of colonialism). But mostly, I enjoyed the natural beauty. And getting out on the water. 
    I will say, staying on St. Kitts seemed much more fun. There's a town, you can explore more. Nevis is across the bay, and really is only resorts (that we saw). We did take a boat out to Nevis and had lunch at a lovely beach cafe, so I would reccomend checking it out.</body>
