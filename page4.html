    Asia is a continent so different from how I grew up, I love exploring the culture and being out of 
    my comfort zone. There is still so much to explore, but here are my travels so far.

    <h1> Japan</h1>
    <h3> Tokyo </h3>
    <body> Tokyo is a CITY. I was on the subway for almost an hour one day, and still hadn't left the city limits. 
        It is huge. Tokyo is also the first city I visited that has a completely different alphabet, which creates for some interesting 
        travel mishaps. Like not being able to figure out that the subway line switches direction in the middle of the day. 
        Either way, I loved Tokyo. I visited the Tsukiji fish market, Ginza , Asakusa, Shibuya, the Imperial Gardens, Tokyo Disneyland. 
        The Tsukiji fish market was one of my favorite stops. It's an expansive market, with great restaurants with all the freshest fish to try. 
        We got there early, and had some raw fish for breakfast! But it was amazing. I would also reccomend seeing the world's busiest crosswalk in 
        Shibuya because it is what I imagined when I thought of Tokyo. My group also made a day trip out to see 
        the Big Buddha at Kamakura, which was great and very peaceful. There are probably a million more things to do in Tokyo- I will have to go back! 
    <p> <strong> Must do: </strong> Tsukiji Fish Market, and have some of the fresh fish </p>

    <h3> Vladivostok </h3>
    <body> When you have a friend with family in Vladivostok, how could you pass up the opportunity to visit Russia? 
        Especially a city I would have otherwise never been to. Vladivostok is on the Eastern Coast of Russia. It's a popular vacation destination for people form 
        China. And they do not get many Americans. We turned heads everywhere we went. Luckily, my friend speaks Russian and gave us a wonderful experience. Vladivostok is  
        the main port for the Eastern side of Russia, so it's the biggest city in the area. The waterfront is the best part in my opinion; there are beaches and piers, and walking around 
        downtown is lovely. We had some typical Russian meals of borscht and dumplings. 
        The hardest part about visiting Russia was the visa process. At the time I went, Seattle still had a Russia embassy and visa center in Seattle. 
        Now, you would have to go, in person, to either San Franscico or Washington, D.C. I feel very lucky that it was relatively easy for me. 
        Still, you have to fill out a lot of paperwork. That is in Russian. Kind of get interviewed. And then send your passport with them and hope it gets approved. 
        As an American, I now have greater sympathy for citizens of countries that routinely have to do this. It takes so much more planning to travel this way; you need an invitation, a place 
        you're staying lined up, reason for going. I do think it is worth it though!

    <h3> Nahodka </h3>
    <body> Nahodka is the beach town outside of Vladivostok that my friend's family has a cabin at. We traveled there by boat, which was amazing. The coast of Russia is still so 
        uninhabited, it felt like we were the only people there. We swam in the ocean, eating sea urchin right out of the sea. We hiked along old WWII bunkers 
        and went fishing at night for squid. I felt so close to nature, it was lovely. 
    <p> <strong> Must do: </strong> Experience the beautiful coast </p>

    <h3> Hong Kong </h3>
    <body> My mother and I visited Hong Kong while my sister was working there. This was before pro-democracy protests were ripping the city 
        apart on a regular basis. Hong Kong is unique in that becasue it is still holding on to it's 'One Country, Two Systems' policy with China, 
        you do not need a visa to visit as an American. So my mother and I jumped at the opportunity to go. 
        Hong Kong was astounding to me because it's not much surface area, but there are still so many people because they have built 
        these amazingly tall buildings on the island. They have more skyscrapers than any other city. Hong Kong is split into two parts; Hong Kong Island (which we stayed on) and the Kowloon side. 
        Hong Kong is a very international city which I really enjoyed. The modern business side of Hong Kong combined with the complex history makes it 
        so interesting. While we were there, we visited Hong Kong Park, the Chi Lin Nunnery, Victoria Peak, and made a trip out to see the Tian Tan Buddha. 
        But one of the best parts was exploring the city on foot, in the shadow of these massive skyscrapers. There is plenty of high-end shopping to do (which we did not partake in, but were amazed by).
        The food is great, especially if you're in the market for dumplings. Which I was. I really enjoyed my visit. 
    <p> <strong> Must do: </strong> Victoria Peak and eat Chinese dumplings </p>
